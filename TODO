GNU Aris -- TODO List

* Interoperability with Isabelle - in progress.
* Documentation
  - Sequence Logic
* Bug Testing
* Printing - Hold off on this

*FOR Bram's Logic class project: -the bugs encountered in windows, need to test if same on linux
  - make rules more user friendly, tooltips are good but there has to be a better way
  - rules menu not long enough to click and drag
  - fix the issue in which the first letter typed in a proof does not show up until a second letter is typed.
  - rearrange the menu bars
  - kill line seems a little harsh (the word for this is cut)
  - edit the default key shortcuts, they should be changed to the standard of (cut,copy,paste) being ctrl+(x,c,v)
    ~fitchify some of the others
  - correct some of the key shortcuts in the pdf to reflect what actually happens (and for our changes)
  - wtf is the contents button for???
  - make the homepage button on the about page work
    ~my error: No application is registered as handling this file
  - the customize display screen gets this error when changing the colors:
    ~G-lib_GIO-ERROR **: NO GSettings schemas are installed on the system
