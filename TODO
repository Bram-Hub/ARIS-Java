GNU Aris -- TODO List

* Interoperability with Isabelle - in progress.
* Documentation
  - Sequence Logic
* Bug Testing
* Printing - Hold off on this

*FOR Bram's Logic class project:
  - make rules more user friendly, tooltips are good but there has to be a better way
  - fix the issue in which the first letter typed in a proof does not show up until a second letter is typed.
  - rearrange the menu bars
  - kill line seems a little harsh (the word for this is cut)
  - edit the default key shortcuts, they should be changed to the standard of (cut,copy,paste) being ctrl+(x,c,v)
    ~fitchify some of the others
  - correct some of the key shortcuts in the pdf to reflect what actually happens (and for our changes)
